# Blockchain Project Terms of Reference

### Overview and Purpose

The Baby Blockchain is a simple and user-friendly blockchain system designed to provide a secure and transparent ledger for recording transactions. The purpose of the system is to enable individuals and organizations to securely store and transfer information and assets on a decentralized network.

### System Content

The Baby Blockchain system consists of the following components:
- Ledger: The ledger is the core component of the system and stores all transactions that occur on the network. The ledger is maintained by a decentralized network of nodes and is secure and transparent.

- Nodes: The nodes are the participants in the network that validate transactions and maintain the ledger. Each node has a copy of the ledger and operates independently to validate transactions and add new blocks to the chain.

- Clients: The clients are the users of the system who initiate transactions and access the ledger. Clients can be individuals or organizations, and they interact with the system through a user-friendly interface.

### Interaction

The Baby Blockchain system is designed to be flexible and interoperable, allowing it to interact with other systems and components. Some potential interactions include:

- Integrating with existing systems: The Baby Blockchain system can be integrated with existing systems to enable secure and transparent data sharing and transfer.

- Interoperating with other blockchains: The Baby Blockchain system can be configured to interact with other blockchain systems to enable seamless transfer of assets and information across multiple networks.

### Product Features
- Decentralized: The Baby Blockchain system is decentralized, meaning that it operates independently of any central authority and is maintained by a network of nodes.

- Secure: The Baby Blockchain system uses state-of-the-art encryption techniques to ensure the security of transactions and the integrity of the ledger.

- Transparent: The Baby Blockchain system is transparent, allowing all users to access and view the ledger and transactions that occur on the network.

- User-friendly: The Baby Blockchain system is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to initiate transactions and access the ledger.

### Security Requirements
The Baby Blockchain system is designed to meet the highest standards of security and privacy, and the following security requirements are built into the system:

- Encryption: All transactions and data stored on the ledger are encrypted to ensure the privacy of users and the security of the network.

- Authentication: Users must authenticate themselves before they can initiate transactions or access the ledger, ensuring that only authorized users can access the system.

- Access control: Access to the ledger and transactions is controlled by the network, ensuring that only authorized users can view or modify the data.
### Characteristics of Users
The Baby Blockchain system is designed for individuals and organizations who are looking for a secure and transparent way to store and transfer information and assets. The end users of the system are:
- Individuals: Individual users can use the Baby Blockchain system to securely store and transfer personal information and assets.

- Organizations: Organizations can use the Baby Blockchain system to securely store and transfer sensitive information and assets, and to share information with other organizations in a secure and transparent manner.
### Restrictions
The Baby Blockchain system is designed to be flexible and user-friendly, but there are some restrictions that must be followed to ensure the security and integrity of the network:
- The system may only be used for lawful purposes and in accordance with the terms of use.
- The system is designed to support a specific blockchain network and is not compatible with other networks.
- Transactions within the system are subject to network limitations, such as gas fees and block size restrictions.
- Users are responsible for ensuring the security of their own private keys and must take appropriate measures to protect their assets within the system.
